        <p>Hi.  My name is Gemma and I am currently an Art Student at The City College of New York. I am focusing on the digital aspect of art and hope to find a career with that in mind.  The internet is a growing part of society that is changing the world in many ways. Choosing this path keeps me living in the present moment with a contemporary knowledge that I think should be passed on.</p>
